The Rise of Nationalism in EuropeImagine you're living in a time when countries were ruled by monarchs and empires, with people from different regions speaking different languages and having their own customs. This was Europe in the 18th century.One artist, Frédéric Sorrieu, had a dream of a world where people lived in democratic and social republics. He created a series of four prints to show his vision of what this world would look like. In one of these prints, we see people from all over Europe and America marching together, led by the United States and Switzerland.This was a utopian vision, a dream of a perfect society where people are equal and free. The artist imagined that people from different nations would come together to form a community based on shared values and goals.What is a NationBut what exactly is a nation A French philosopher named Ernst Renan wrote an essay called \What is a Nation\ in 1882. He argued that a nation is not just about language, race, or territory, but about something deeper.According to Renan, a nation is formed by a shared history and common values. It's a community of people who have come together through their struggles and achievements. A nation has a social capital that is built on the sacrifices and devotion of its members.Renan believed that nations are important because they provide a sense of identity and belonging to their citizens. They also promote freedom and liberty, as each nation has its own laws and government.The French Revolution and NationalismThe first clear expression of nationalism came with the French Revolution in 1789. The revolutionaries introduced new ideas and practices that created a sense of collective identity among the French people.They emphasized the importance of la patrie (the fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen), and introduced a new flag, the tricolour. They also established a centralised administrative system, uniform laws, and a common language.The French Revolution had a significant impact on Europe, as it spread the idea of nationalism to other countries. The revolutionaries declared that it was their mission to liberate the peoples of Europe from despotism, helping them to become nations.Napoleon's LegacyNapoleon, who rose to power after the French Revolution, introduced many reforms in the territories under his control. He established a civil code, which established equality before the law and secured the right to property.He also simplified administrative divisions, abolished the feudal system, and freed peasants from serfdom and manorial dues. However, the local populations' reactions to French rule were mixed, with some welcoming them as harbingers of liberty, while others turned hostile due to increased taxation, censorship, and forced conscription.In conclusion, nationalism emerged in Europe as a force that brought about sweeping changes in politics and society. The concept of a nation-state developed over time, with citizens developing a sense of common identity and shared history or descent. Nationalism promoted freedom and liberty, but also had its challenges and limitations.Key Terms: Absolutist: A government or system of rule that has no restraints on power exercised.

Plebiscite: A direct vote by which all people in a region are asked to accept or reject a proposal.Activities:1. Imagine you're living in a time when countries were ruled by monarchs and empires. Write a short story about how nationalism emerged in your country, and what changes it brought about.2. Create a visual representation of Renan's idea of a nation as a shared history and common values.3. Debate the importance of nations and nationalism in modern society. Do they promote freedom and liberty, or create divisions and conflicts
